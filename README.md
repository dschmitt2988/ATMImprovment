# ATMImprovment
Project Description: A simple ATM application that tracks the deposits and withdraws from a bank account

Improvements: 
1. Orignal ATM had bad user interface for the buttons of "Deposit" or "Cash Back", improvements removed the buttons and changed this to a user friendly component of a dropdown menu to select Deposit or Cash Back. 
2. Created conditional rendering to now allow the input field for the dollar amount to show up until the user has selected the Deposit or Cash Back options. 
3.  Added input validation to prevent Cash Back amounts from overdrawing the account balance.
